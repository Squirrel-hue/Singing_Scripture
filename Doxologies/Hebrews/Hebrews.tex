\section*{Hebrew 13:20, 21}

\noindent 20 Now may the God of peace who has\\
brought from the dead Jesus our Lord\\
the great Shepherd of all His sheep\\
through the eternal cov'nant's blood\\

\noindent 21 Make you perfect for all good work\\
Working in you what pleases Him\\
Through Jesus Christ--[well-pleased Son]\\\footnote{This is an idea from the Baptism and Transfiguration of Jesus (Mt. 3:17, 17:5); it is undesirable to interpolate in this manner; perhaps another meter is required.}\footnote{Another line considered was \textbf{Through Jesus Christ [all in Him ours]}, which is a reference to I Cor. 3:21, 22. Again, this interpolate from another text.}
To whom be glory, now always. Amen.

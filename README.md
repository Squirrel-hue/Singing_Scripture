# Introduction

To make music and sing is common human experience.  The first mention of musical instruments in Sacred Scriptures---comes not in reference to worship of God---but from the offspring of Cain (Ge. 4:21); in the near context of those who exhibited at least an equal measure of Cain's malevolence if not sevenfold portion of it.

Naturally, the idea of creating music and singing can be understood as an implied component of the Creation Mandate. We are told that in the days of Seth's son Enosh, people began to call on the name of YHWH. We are not told for sure, but there is no difficulty in imagining singing arising in any activity in which human affections are engaged. 

# Psalms

To sing Psalms is to join voices with millenia of singers, songs that go back as far as Moses (perhaps as far back as 14th or 15th century B.C.)

Early writings, of which the early utterances of Genesis (for instances, Lamech's discourse to his wives in Ge. 4) and Job, appear to, at a minimum, have a rhythm and structure, and these would lend themselves to music.

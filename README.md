To make music and sing is common human experience.  The first mention of musical instruments in Sacred Scriptures---comes not in reference to worship of God---but from the offspring of Cain; in the near context of those who exhibited at least an equal measure of Cain's malevolence if not sevenfold portion of it.

Naturally, the idea of creating music and singing can be understood as an implied component of the Creation Mandate.

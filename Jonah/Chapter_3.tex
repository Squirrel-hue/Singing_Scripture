\section*{Jonah's Prayer}

Jonah 2:17 And YHWH appointed a great fish to swallow up Jonah; and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.

\subsubsection*{Jonah 3}

1 Then Jonah prayed to YHWH God\newline
saying from the belly of the fish\newline
2 I called to YHWH in distress,\newline
He mercifully answered me.\newline

Out of the belly of Sheol\newline
I cried and Thou didst hear my voice\newline
3 For thou didst cast me in[to] the deep\newline
into the heart of raging sea\newline

And the mighty flood surrounded me\newline
Over me passed Thy waves, billows \newline
4 "Cast out I am from Thy presence"\newline
"Shall I Thy Holy Temple see?"\newline

5 The water closed in over me\newline
And the deep round about me was\newline
Weeds were wrap-ped about my head\newline
6 at the deep roots of the mountains\newline

I went down to the land whose bars\newline
Closed upon me forevermore\newline
yet Thou didst raise me from the Pit\newline
My life raised, O YHWH my God\newline

7 When my soul fainted within me\newline
I remembered YHWH and my prayer\newline
reached Thee in Thy Holy Temple\newline
8 not like idol'ters Thee forsake\newline

9 But with the voice of thanksgiving\newline
I will sacrifice to Thee\newline
What I have vow-ed I will pay\newline
Deliv'rance belongs to YHWH.\newline

10 And YHWH spoke to the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.
